fastvcs is a replacement for vcs_info in zsh. It runs about twice as fast as the
builtin function.

Most of what this program does is read the first line of `git status --branch
-uno --porcelain=v1`, but that's about all I've ever needed anyway.

There is no configuration. If there is something you want to change (colors, vcs
program, etc) you will have to recompile the program.

Build with

	make

Add to PATH with

	make install

And then add to your zsh prompt with something like this:

	setopt PROMPT_SUBST
	PS1+=' $(fastvcs)'


test.sh will run zsh with an empty .zshrc, one with fastvcs, and one with the
builtin vcs_info, so you can compare the differences.

Here is a sample test for this project:

	Benchmark 1: ZDOTDIR=./test/slowvcs/ zsh -i -c exit
	  Time (mean ± σ):     102.7 ms ±   3.8 ms    [User: 50.1 ms, System: 42.5 ms]
	  Range (min … max):    98.5 ms … 116.1 ms    29 runs

	Benchmark 2: ZDOTDIR=./test/fastvcs/ zsh -i -c exit
	  Time (mean ± σ):      53.2 ms ±   1.6 ms    [User: 24.0 ms, System: 22.3 ms]
	  Range (min … max):    51.1 ms …  59.6 ms    54 runs

	Benchmark 3: ZDOTDIR=./test/baseline/ zsh -i -c exit
	  Time (mean ± σ):      23.8 ms ±   1.1 ms    [User: 11.0 ms, System: 9.7 ms]
	  Range (min … max):    22.8 ms …  29.2 ms    96 runs

	Summary
	  ZDOTDIR=./test/baseline/ zsh -i -c exit ran
	    2.24 ± 0.12 times faster than ZDOTDIR=./test/fastvcs/ zsh -i -c exit
	    4.32 ± 0.25 times faster than ZDOTDIR=./test/slowvcs/ zsh -i -c exit
